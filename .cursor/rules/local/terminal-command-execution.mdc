        message: "Always use bash shell for terminal commands, not PowerShell or other shells."
      - pattern: "run_button"
        message: "Always use the run button mechanism rather than manual copy/paste for terminal commands."
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "manual_paste"
        message: "Manual copy/paste of terminal commands leads to paste buffer errors and escape sequence corruption."
      - pattern: "powershell_preference"
        message: "PowerShell has more issues with quote escaping and special characters compared to bash."
examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Manual copy/paste leading to corruption
      [200~cd client_app/cat_tracker_app && flutter run --debug~
      bash: [200~cd: command not found
      
      # Bad: PowerShell with quote escaping issues
      git commit -m \"Complex message with quotes\"
      
      # Good: Bash with run button
      run_terminal_cmd: cd client_app/cat_tracker_app && flutter run --debug
      
      # Good: Complex multi-line commands via run button
      git add -A && git commit -m "Multi-line
      commit message
      with proper formatting"
    output: "Reliable terminal command execution without paste buffer corruption"
guidelines:
  - "Always use bash shell for consistent Unix-style command support on Windows"
  - "Always use run button to send commands directly to shell without clipboard involvement"
  - "Especially important for complex commands with quotes, special characters, or multi-line content"
  - "Eliminates bracketed paste mode interference and escape sequence corruption"
  - "Provides consistent environment state maintenance across commands"
  - "Essential for git operations, Flutter commands, and file operations"
