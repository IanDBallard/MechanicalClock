# Documentation-First Development

<rule>
name: documentation-first
description: Ensures that project documentation is consulted and updated before any functional code changes are made. The agent must verify if changes are consistent with requirements and update relevant design documents.
filters:
  - type: user_intent
    pattern: "request for functional change|add feature|modify behavior|delete functionality"
  - type: event
    pattern: "code_edit_request"
  - type: file_type
    pattern: "*.md|*.dart|*.ino|*.cpp|*.h"
actions:
  - type: procedure
    message: "When requested to add, delete, or change functionality, the AI must follow this procedure:"
    steps:
      - "1. *Analyze Request:* Identify the core functional change being requested."
      - "2. *Consult Documents:* Review the following documents for contradictions or necessary updates: Requirements.md, FiniteStateMachine.md, Screen Design.md, DesignDecisions.md, README.md."
      - "3. *Report Findings:* Inform the user of any conflicts with the documentation and list all documents that will require updates to reflect the change."
      - "4. *Await Agreement:* Do not proceed with code implementation until the user agrees on the proposed documentation changes."
      - "5. *Implement & Document:* Once agreed, implement the code changes and update the relevant documentation concurrently."
examples:
  - input: |
      # User Request (Incorrect Interaction)
      USER: "Add a button to the main screen that silences the tracker."
      AI: (Immediately starts writing code to add the button without checking documentation)
    output: "Incorrect - bypasses documentation check"
  - input: |
      # User Request (Correct Interaction)
      USER: "Add a button to the main screen that silences the tracker."
      AI: "Okay, I can add a silence button. [Based on our documentation-first process][[memory:185097]], I've checked the project documents. This will require updates to Screen Design.md and FiniteStateMachine.md. Do you agree?"
    output: "Correct - proactive, documentation-aware response that ensures alignment before implementation"
guidelines:
  - "This rule prioritizes documentation as the single source of truth for the project's design and requirements"
  - "Maintaining consistency between code and documentation is critical for long-term project health"
  - "Always consult Requirements.md, FiniteStateMachine.md, Screen Design.md, DesignDecisions.md, and README.md before functional changes"
  - "Wait for user agreement on documentation changes before implementing code"
