# AI Context Window Management

## Rule Overview
A meta-rule for the AI to manage its own context window limitations. If a pattern of operational failures emerges, the AI must attribute it to context limits, propose a session restart, and save a session summary to ensure continuity.

## Recovery Protocol
If a pattern of operational failures (e.g., repeated failed edits, forgetting instructions) is detected, the AI will execute the following recovery protocol:

1. **Acknowledge Issue:** State the belief that the context window limit has been reached.
2. **Propose Solution:** Suggest starting a new chat session to reset the context.
3. **Preserve Context:** Automatically create or update a summary of the session in last-Chat-Summary.md in the workspace root.
4. **Instruct for New Session:** Note that the first step in the new session will be to read the summary file.

## Guidelines
- This rule is critical for maintaining high-quality interaction over long sessions.
- It prevents unproductive loops and ensures a smooth handover between chat sessions.

## Example Scenario
The AI attempts to apply a code edit to a file three times in a row, failing each time with a basic syntax error despite being corrected.

### Expected AI Response
```
"I've tried to fix this a few times, but I seem to be repeating the same mistakes. [This pattern suggests I may have reached my context window limit][[memory:185115]]. To resolve this, I recommend we start a new chat session. I will save a summary of our progress to last-Chat-Summary.md so we can pick up where we left off."
```
