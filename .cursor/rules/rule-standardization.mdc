      When creating Cursor rules:
      1. Initially place all new rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/local/
      2. Once the rule is finalized, move it to PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/
      3. Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., my-rule-name.mdc)
      4. Use the .mdc extension (NOT .rule.md or other variations)
      5. Make filenames descriptive of the rule's purpose
      6. Include required sections in this order:
         - H1 title
         - <rule> block with:
           - name (kebab-case)
           - description
           - filters
           - actions
           - examples (with good/bad cases)
           - guidelines (if applicable)
           - metadata (priority, version, category, tags)
      7. Ensure proper YAML/markdown formatting
      8. Update this rule if new best practices are established
examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule files in wrong locations or formats
      rules/myRule.mdc
      myrule.rule.md
      .rules/my-rule.mdc
      .cursor/rules/MyRule.mdc
      .cursor/rules/my_rule.mdc
      
      # Good: Rule files in correct location and format
      # New rules (initially)
      .cursor/rules/local/new-api-endpoints.mdc
      .cursor/rules/local/new-code-style.mdc
      
      # Finalized rules
      .cursor/rules/api-endpoints.mdc
      .cursor/rules/code-style.mdc
      .cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed and named Cursor rule files"
guidelines:
  - "Use kebab-case for all rule filenames"
  - "Place new rules in .cursor/rules/local first for testing"
  - "Move finalized rules to .cursor/rules directory"
  - "Use the <rule> block format for official Cursor compatibility"
  - "Include comprehensive examples with good/bad patterns"
  - "Document migration plans when changing rule formats"
