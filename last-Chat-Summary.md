# Mechanical Clock Project - Session Summary

## Project Overview
Arduino UNO R4 WiFi-based mechanical clock with onboard RTC, WiFi connectivity, NTP time synchronization, and I2C LCD display.

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues
1. **WiFi Credentials Clearing**: Removed temporary debug code that was clearing WiFi credentials on startup
2. **Test Environment Upload**: Fixed by explicitly targeting production environment (`uno_r4_wifi`)
3. **DHCP/IP Address Issue**: Resolved by implementing proper WiFi reset pattern (`WiFi.end(); delay(1000); WiFi.begin()`) and extended DHCP wait time (15 seconds)
4. **LCD Artifacts**: Fixed by implementing selective clearing that preserves network status icons while clearing only time/date/messaging areas

### ‚úÖ Current Functionality
- **WiFi Connection**: Working with proper DHCP IP assignment
- **NTP Time Sync**: Functional with automatic time synchronization
- **LCD Display**: Clean display with proper real estate management
  - Date: Positions 0-13 on line 0
  - Time: Positions 0-7 on line 1
  - Network status icons: Position 15 on both lines (preserved during clearing)
- **RTC**: Onboard real-time clock operational
- **Mechanical Clock**: Stepper motor control ready

### üîß Technical Architecture
- **OOP Refactor**: Network logic encapsulated in `NetworkManager` class
- **State Management**: `StateManager` handles system states and transitions
- **LCD Management**: `LCDDisplay` class with proper boundary management
- **PlatformIO**: Production environment (`uno_r4_wifi`) configured and working

### üìÅ Key Files
- `src/main.cpp`: Main firmware entry point
- `src/NetworkManager.cpp`: WiFi and NTP functionality
- `src/LCDDisplay.cpp`: LCD display management with selective clearing
- `src/StateManager.cpp`: System state management
- `platformio.ini`: Build configuration

### üéØ Next Steps (Optional)
- Monitor long-term stability
- Consider adding additional features (timezone support, etc.)
- Performance optimization if needed

## Session Notes
- Successfully resolved persistent DHCP issue through iterative debugging
- Implemented proper LCD real estate management to prevent artifacts
- All core functionality now operational and stable
